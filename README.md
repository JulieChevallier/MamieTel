# MamieTel

MamieTel is a website developed for the [`Nuit de l'Info`](https://www.nuitdelinfo.com/) event in collaboration with [Tristan-Mihai Radulescu](https://github.com/Milou666). The goal of the project was to gamify a website adapted for elderly people.

We decided to create a website inspired by the Minitel, an early French computer network that was widely used in the 1980s and 1990s. The website offers a simple and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate for seniors.

The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can try the site [here](https://milou666.github.io/).


## Features
MamieTel offers several features that make it an ideal platform for elderly people:

* Simple and intuitive interface inspired by the Minitel design
* Large font sizes and high contrast colors for improved readability
* Features accessible without a mouse
* Easy navigation through the use of menus and categories
